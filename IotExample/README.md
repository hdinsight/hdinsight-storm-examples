# Internet of Things example
This is an example for IOT (Internet of Things) scenario using Storm. The basic idea is to showcase how to use Storm topology to read messages from Azure EventHubs, read document from Azure Cosmos DB for data referencing and save data to Azure Storage.

For this example to work end to end, along with the Storm topology (iot), following tools have been provided:

1. EventHubs event generator (eventgen) 
2. Azure Cosmos DB document generator (docdbgen)

## Source code
vehiclegen.py: this is a simple python scripts to generate random vehicle VIN number and model number as a text file (vehiclevin.txt).

eventgen: the Azure EventHubs generator, a standalone java program to write messages to Azure EventHubs. It uses the vehicle info to generate engine temperature messages for each vehicle.

docdbgen: The Azure Cosmos DB generator, a standalone java program to create an Azure Cosmos DB collection that stores vehicle VIN to model number map. Later the document DB is used to retrieve model number from the VIN.

iot: The Storm topology, it has the following components:
EventHubSpout: source of stream
TypeConversionBolt: converts EventHubs message in JSON format into fields in a tuple
DataReferenceBolt: enrich data by reading Azure Cosmos DB to get models for a given VIN
WasbStoreBolt: write the enriched data points into Azure Blob Storage

## Prerequisites
In order to build and run the example, you need to have:

1. Java 1.7/1.8 SDK.
2. Maven 3.x - If you have M2_HOME configured, the examples should detect your mvn automatically.
3. Latest version of Azure Powershell (0.8.13 or later).
4. An active Azure subscription for deploying Azure services for example execution.

NOTE: The access to Windows Azure Blob Storage requires hadoop-azure jar, which can only be built from Apache hadoop trunk at this point (it will be included in Hadoop 2.7). You can choose to build yourself, or you can use the prebuilt jar included in the lib folder.

## How to build
Use ```IoTExample\build.bat``` to build the example.

## How to run
Use ```IoTExample\run.bat``` to run the example that will create resources in Azure, build and submit the example topology.

```IMPORTANT NOTES:```
* During the process, you will be prompted to login with your Azure credentials and type your subscription name.
* This will first create all dependencies (Azure Cosmos DB, EventHubs, Storage) in Azure, then update configuration files, then build all 3 projects.
* This script will open a browser window for the external Storm UI, you need to enter Storm cluster credentials, they are stored at config\configurations.properties
* In the case of failure in creating resources in Azure, you can run ```IoTExample\cleanup.bat``` which will delete resources that have been created.

## How to clean and delete all resources in Azure and local build artifacts ###
Use ```IoTExample\cleanup.bat``` to delete the resources created from previous step and also any local build generated artifacts.
