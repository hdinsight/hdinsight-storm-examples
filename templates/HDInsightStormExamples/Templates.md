This project contains templates for spouts, bolts and topologies to interact with various Azure services like EventHub, DocumentDB, SQL Azure.
These templates will be available through the HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio.

Please follow the //TODO comments to setup your input and output schemas correctly between the spouts and bolts.
You can also use a pre-exisiting run configuration (run\configuraton.properties) from any of the examples folder to use with this templates solution.
